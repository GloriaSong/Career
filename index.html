                    <p>“Education and job searching are the rigid demand for students,” said Qinyuan Feng, the former director of Alibaba and the founder of Bit Tiger, an IT-focused online career training platform based in Silicon Valley that hopes to fill
                        up the gap between traditional education and practical implement in working environment.
                    </p>
                    <p>“When students in K12 can improve their academic performance through doing exercises, fresh graduates can also learn career skills through online system,” said Barbara Yu Jia, the founder and CEO of the <a href="http://www.unicareer.org/"

                    <p>The online nature of those platforms give them a brand new of promotion in this information era. Like C2C counseling platforms, those career oriented training platforms spend most of their efforts on social media.

                    </p>
                    <p>“I don’t think their promotions on social media will have a direct positive effect on the conversion of content readers to membership subscribers”, said Yuxin Yao, who heard about the Dream Big Career through her friend’s Moment on
                        Wechat, the most popular social media in China.
                    </p>
                    <p>“Though the content is quite attractive and I reposted the post for the free training materials, I will not get the detailed information about the paid membership schemes unless I go for the social media operator who I added for the
                        free materials and talk with him/her.”
                    </p>
                    <p>Yuxin did not subscribe the membership nor pay for the online courses since she believed “the price is too high and there are still many platforms providing free materials though may in a random time schedule”. She also admitted that
                        she might pay for certain package only if she could not get enough information through personal research on certain industry.
                    </p>
                    <p>Besides the online promotion, the UniCareer has cooperated with universities to acquire sources of clients, namely students. The company says on its official website that it has built up relationship with 10 universities in the United
                        States.

                    </p>
                    <p>But this United States focused company shifted their strategies seeing the potential of increasing number of students coming back to China after graduating from overseas universities and the fact that 20 percent of their registered
                        users are from domestic universities.

                    </p>
                    <p>“We want to attract those talented students in “985” and “211” universities (which are the top universities in China) through our successful record in the overseas market,” said Barbara.
                    </p>

                    <p>UniCareer has more than 200,000 followers on Wechat and 25,000 registered users, 65 percent of whom are Chinese nationality students.
                    </p>
                    <p>It has also built up long term partnership with Alibaba, Fuson, and HNA Group and “interview cooperation relationship” with more than 1,500 corporations.
                    </p>
                    <p>The founder and CEO Barbara Yu graduating from Fudan University was a private equity research analyst at Morgan Stanley. The co-founder Denise Wang graduating from Yale University was a Vice President and Relationship Manager at BlackRock

                    <p>“We are trying to take a share of profit from the head-hunters by helping the company save the pre-entry job training fees,” Barbara told the iHeima, a Chinese media focused on startup companies.

                    </p>
                    <p>She added that the profit model for the company is B2C2B and they will stick to the strategy that is “B side for resources, C side for profit”. For the first Business side, or the school side, the company sells their online training
                        materials in packages to those universities to help them with their career guidance services. For the other Business side, or the company side, “we can help them save time and money to do the pre-entry job training”.

                    <p>
                        The two major categories of courses provided on the UniCareer are online courses with an average cost of US$100 and offline courses costing around US$1,100, Barbara said. Though the offline courses are more expensive, its profit margin is 47 percent while
                        that of the online courses is 80 percent. 43 percent of users will repurchase the online courses.

                    <p>
                        “We will try to dig out the value of our users by encouraging students who looked for jobs to be mentors in the future,” said Barbara.

                    <p>
                        Qinyuan said the BitTiger had 20,000 registered users and the payment conversion rate is around 10 percent when the average cost for one lesson is US$1,000. The gross profit margin is 70 percent while the net profit margin is over 10 percent according
                        to the company’s report.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “We aim to achieve 100 million annual turnover within the next three years,” Qinyuan said. BitTiger will launch courses fully delivered in English in the next half of this year to expand the target consumers to all people in the United States, not limited
                        to Chinese people. The company has 23 full-time employees, one third of them are technicians.

                    <p>
                        After the newly elected President of the United States Donald Trump banned the entry of people from seven Muslim majority countries, the Trump’s administration has amended the H1B visa guidelines to further stimulate domestic hiring of United States’
                        citizens.

                    </p>
                    <p>The H-1B visa is a non-immigration visa for specialized foreign people to work in the United States. In principle, it requires employers to provide the position to foreign citizens only if they cannot find a suitable American worker.

                    </p>
                    <p>The US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS) has released the revised H-1B guidelines dated March 31, 2017 saying that “an entry-level computer programmer would not generally qualify as a position in a specialty occupation”.

                    </p>
                    <p>According to the data from Open Doors, an information provider sponsored by the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs at the U.S. Department of State, 14 percent of the Chinese students studying in the United States majored in
                        Computer Science, which is the third most popular major group after Business/Management and Engineering. This policy thus has a severe adverse impact on those people.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        “The H-1B visa program should help US companies recruit highly-skilled foreign nationals when there is a shortage of qualified workers in the country. Yet, too many American workers who are as qualified, willing, and deserving to work in these fields
                        have been ignored or unfairly disadvantaged,” the USCIS explained.

                    </p>
                    <p>On April 18, a new <a href="https://zh.scribd.com/document/345549964/Eo-Buy-America-Final-04-18-17 ">
                                        Executive Order </a>named “Buy American and Hire American” suggested “reforms to help ensure that H-1B visas are awarded to the most-skilled or highest-paid petition beneficiaries.”

                    </p>
                    <p>The Justice Department of the United States also warned employers not to “discriminate against U.S. workers” by over hiring foreign workers on April 3 which marks the commencement of the H-1B Visa application for fiscal year 2018.

                    </p>
                    <p>In addition, the High-Skilled Integrity and Fairness Act of 2017 introduced by California Congressman Zoe Lofgren proposes to lift the minimum annual income requirement for applying for the H1B visa to US$130,000 if the employer does
                        not want to testify "regarding recruitment and non-displacement of U.S. workers". The amount is more than doubling the current minimum annual income of US$60,000 which was established in 1989.
                    </p>
                    <p>United States has also launched several practices to avoid the misconduct of the H1B visa. Site-visiting by officers from the Fraud Detection and National Security is one of the verification approach adopted since 2009.
                    </p>
                    <p> “It is more and more difficult to get a H1B visa these days,” complaint Meizhi Wang, a senior undergraduate student at Washington University in St. Louis. The petition for H-1B is still increasingly competitive and therefore has to
                        be decided by lottery draws in recent years.
                    </p>
                    <p>That is quite true especially when the number of overseas students booms dramatically these day but the total quota is still fixed at the 58,000, if excluding the fixed quota assigned to Singapore and Chile.
                    </p>
                    <p> In 2016, the USCIS received 236,000 petitions for fiscal year 2017, almost three times as much as the total cap of 85,000. But as of April 17, 2017, according to the data from the USCIS, the number of H1B petition has dropped 16 percent
                        compared with the previous year to 199,000 which marks the first time since 2014 that the number is below 200,000.

                    <p>“It is more and more difficult to get a H1B visa these days especially when the number of overseas students booms dramatically these day but the total quota is still fixed at the 58,000, if excluding the fixed quota assigned to Singapore
                        and Chile,” said Meizhi Wang, a senior undergraduate student at Washington University in St. Louis.

                    <p>The working policy for overseas students was also tightened in the United Kingdom. In 2012, the UK government cancelled the Post Study Work visa which allows overseas graduates to work in the UK for two years.

                    <p>“My parents can provide me more connections and resources in job searching if I come back to mainland after graduation,” said Haoyue Xu, currently pursuing her bachelor's degree in Hong Kong Baptist University.

                    </p>
                    <p>"Now that I can hardly get a journalism job in the United State after the Optional Practical Training period (permitted by USCIS for students with F-1 Visa who have completed or have been pursuing their degrees for more than nine months),
                        why not go back to China right after graduation and get a well-paid job in a place that I am familiar with," said Lindsay Long, who has been admitted to the Journalism School of Columbia University in the city of New York.

                    </p>
                    <p>Both two mentioned the fact that they are the only child in their family. Haoyue said her parents hope that she could work in China after graduation for family reunion and Lindsay mentioned her desire to take care of her parents since
                        they are getting older and older.

                    </p>
                    <p>However, returning China to work is not that easy as imagined. Many returnees are facing reverse culture shock, just as they faced as a freshman when studying overseas.

                    </p>
                    <p>“There is an invisible shield between my friends in domestic universities and I. We are like the most familiar strangers since we no longer have common topics,” said Yue Ma. “I have not joined the classmate reunion since graduating
                        from High School since I was always in Canada when most of my classmates are having their semester break in China.”

                    </p>
                    <p>She also concerned about working opportunities, many of which may need internal reference. “I can hardly have as many alumni as those students graduating from domestic universities when most of my friends and professors are in Canada.”

                    <p>The time gap of academic year, the limited information channels, the discrepancies between ideal salaries and the reality all deter overseas graduates from returning back to China. But those are exactly the strengthens or the value
                        of those online job searching platforms.When the number of Chinese students getting back to their motherland after graduating from overseas universities increase dramatically, this job searching market will expand in line with
                        the former one’s speed.
